### v1.3.3 - New Version; New Updates! 

**Payments made easier 💳**
- We have brought in new payment support, to make purchasing credits and paying for subscription easier. 

**Never lose your data again 💾**
With our new Back-up Hard Disk feature, you can take a copy of your data and store it safely in a Back-up Hard Disk provided for each project. If you delete any data by mistake, restore from your recent back-up. 

**Force stop to the rescue ⏹**
If your project takes longer to start, the force stop button pops-up and on click stops the staging process. The control is now in your hands 

**Extending our support 📞**
With some new improvements, you can now search for help articles directly in the support chat with just keywords and also get quick guided help for simpler queries.

**Customise your timer ⏱**
On top of the 3 timer options we now have a custom time option that allows you to set any number of hours you require your instance to run without exhausting extra credits. 

**NimbleBox Community 👬🏽**
The improved community login allows NimbleBox users to access community and join discussions in a click. No need to re-enter login details!

**Documentation 📑**
We have moved our documentation to http://docs.nimblebox.ai. You can access this from inside the product too. 

**Not so small things 🧮**
- Bug fixes and optimisations to our architecture to **improve platform stability and scalability**.
