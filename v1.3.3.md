### v1.3.3 - New Version; New Updates! 

**Payments made easier 💳**

We have brought in new payment support to make purchasing credits and paying for subscriptions easier. 


**Never lose your data again 💾** 

With our new Backup Hard Disk feature, you can take a copy of your data and store it safely in a Backup Hard Disk provided for each project. Then, if you delete any data by mistake, restore it from your recent backup.


**Force stop to the rescue ⏹**

If your project takes longer to start, the force stop button pops up and stops the staging process on click. The control is now in your hands.


**Extending our support 📞**

With some new improvements, you can now search for help articles directly in the support chat with just keywords and get quick guided help for more straightforward queries.


**Customize your timer ⏱**

On top of the three timer options, we now have a custom time option that allows you to set any time you require your instance to run without exhausting extra credits.


**NimbleBox Community 👬🏽**

The improved community login allows NimbleBox users to access the community and join discussions with a click. No need to re-enter login details!


**Documentation 📑**

We have moved our documentation to http://docs.nimblebox.ai. You can access this from inside the product too. 


**Not so small things 🧮**
- Bug fixes and optimizations to our architecture to improve platform stability and scalability.
- The added security measure, captcha verification, during sign-in. No one likes a spammer.
- Never miss out on what happens with your projects with our new email notification system.
